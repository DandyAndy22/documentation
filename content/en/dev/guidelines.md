## Introduction {#intro}

Thank you for dedicating time to making an open source contribution to Mastodon! These guidelines are meant to serve as a baseline for contributino expectations, etiquette and best practices. We've highlighted some key points below, but be sure to explore the additional resources if you have further questions or concerns.

## Code Styling {#style}

We use ESLint & Prettier, so running both is advised to keep your code within acceptable parameters.

## Pull Requests {#requests}

* Before jumping into a PR be sure to search existing PRs or issues for an open or closed item that relates to your submission.
* Write a short and concise title; go into greater detail in the description & provide artifacts like screenshots & screen recordings to give the reviewer greater insight into the work you've accomplished.
* Starting titles using one of the verbs "Add", "Change", "Deprecate", "Remove", or "Fix" (present tense) is helpful for maintaining compatibility with the [keepachangelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) spec we try to adhere to.
* Find additonal tips and other requirements in the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
